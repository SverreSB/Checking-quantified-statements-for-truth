# Checking-quentified-statements-for-truth
This was the final math project for discreet mathematics. The program is written in Javascript. 


Overview of my program

The main idea with this program is to take a quantified statement and check if it is true for the domain given. In the program you can choose between four domains. I also have list of static statements that will be checked for truth. I also have a functionality to negate the expression so you can see the contradiction for the statement with the truth value for the negation. I have used a simple search algorithm that is basically a linear search that breaks when value is found. I also used functions to check if the elements in the domain was even or not. 


How to use the program

Download the file, if you click twice on the file after you've downloaded it,  it will open in your default browser. For the first dropdown menu you can chose a domain, when you chose a domain it will be printed out for you to see. The domain will also be used to check the truth value. When you have chosen a domain, you can choose a universal statement to check if the elements support the condition or not. After that you can chose to negate the expression or keep original. Every time you change any of the lists, the truth value will update so it supports the condition.
